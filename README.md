# Energy Sensor Generator

A Home Assistant custom integration that automatically generates kWh energy sensors from power sensors (in Watts) for use in the Energy dashboard. Unlike other solutions, it operates entirely in Python, avoiding YAML-based helpers like `integration` (Riemann Sum) or `utility_meter`, making it tidy, self-contained, and easy to manage.

[![Add to HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=vortitron&repository=energy-sensor-generator&category=integration)

## Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies all power sensors (`unit: W` or `kW`, `device_class: power`) in Home Assistant.
- **Smart Energy Calculation**: Uses Home Assistant's statistical data for accurate energy calculations, especially for intermittent loads like heaters, with fallback to trapezoidal rule.
- **Statistical Accuracy**: For peaky/intermittent devices (hot water heaters, dishwashers), uses mean power values from Home Assistant's recorder instead of point sampling to avoid missing energy consumption.
- **Daily and Monthly Tracking**: Tracks energy usage with automatic daily and monthly resets, replacing the `utility_meter` helper.
- **Flexible Generation**: Supports automatic sensor creation on startup or manual triggering via a UI button.
- **Energy Dashboard Compatibility**: Generates sensors with `device_class: energy` and `state_class: total_increasing` for seamless integration.
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves energy data to a JSON file to survive Home Assistant restarts.
- **No Dependencies**: Pure Python implementation, no need for MQTT, Node-RED, or external integrations.
- **HACS Ready**: Easily installed via the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS).

## How It Works
The `energy_sensor_generator` integration simplifies energy monitoring by creating kWh sensors for devices like Tuya smart plugs that report power in Watts. Here's a detailed breakdown of its operation:

1. **Power Sensor Detection**:
   - The integration scans the Home Assistant entity registry for sensors with `unit_of_measurement: W` or `kW` and `device_class: power` (e.g., `sensor.plug_1_power`).
   - It supports any device providing power data, such as Tuya plugs via LocalTuya or other integrations.

2. **Energy Calculation**:
   - For each power sensor, it creates a custom `EnergySensor` that calculates kWh by integrating power over time.
   - **NEW**: The integration now intelligently chooses between two calculation methods:
     - **Statistical Method** (Primary): Uses Home Assistant's statistical data (mean power values) from the recorder database for highly accurate energy calculations, especially for intermittent/peaky devices like hot water heaters.
     - **Point Sampling Method** (Fallback): Uses the traditional trapezoidal rule with instantaneous power readings when statistical data is unavailable.
   - **Why Statistical is Better**: For devices that cycle on/off frequently (heaters, dishwashers), point sampling every 60 seconds can miss significant energy consumption. Statistical calculation uses the mean power over time periods, capturing all energy usage regardless of when sampling occurs.
   - Energy values are updated at regular intervals (default 60 seconds) with the most accurate method available.
   - Data is stored in a JSON file (`.storage/energy_sensor_generator.json`) to persist across restarts.

3. **Daily and Monthly Tracking**:
   - For each power sensor, it creates `DailyEnergySensor` and `MonthlyEnergySensor` entities (e.g., `sensor.plug_1_daily_energy`, `sensor.plug_1_monthly_energy`).
   - These sensors track the cumulative kWh from the `EnergySensor` and reset automatically at midnight (daily) or the 1st of the month (monthly).
   - Reset times and values are stored in the JSON file for continuity.

4. **Sensor Generation**:
   - **Automatic Mode**: If enabled in the config flow, sensors are generated when Home Assistant starts or the integration is reloaded.
   - **Manual Mode**: Users can trigger generation via a Lovelace button that calls the `energy_sensor_generator.generate_sensors` service.
   - Duplicate sensors are avoided using unique IDs based on the power sensor's name.

5. **Energy Dashboard Integration**:
   - All generated sensors have `device_class: energy`, `state_class: total_increasing`, and `unit_of_measurement: kWh`, making them compatible with the Home Assistant Energy dashboard.
   - Users can add `*_daily_energy` or `*_monthly_energy` sensors to the dashboard for visualization.

6. **Storage and Performance**:
   - Energy data is saved in `.storage/energy_sensor_generator.json`, with minimal disk usage (a few KB per sensor).
   - The integration uses efficient event handling (`async_track_state_change_event`) to monitor power sensor updates, scaling well for multiple devices.
   - Update frequency is configurable via the `update_interval` setting (default: 60 seconds).

## Requirements
- **Home Assistant**: Version 2023.6.0 or later.
- **Power Sensors**: Devices (e.g., Tuya smart plugs) that expose power sensors with `unit: W` or `kW` and `device_class: power`. LocalTuya is recommended for Tuya plugs due to faster updates.
- **HACS**: For easy installation (manual installation is also supported).
- **No External Dependencies**: No MQTT, Node-RED, or additional integrations required.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install the `energy_sensor_generator` integration:

1. **Add to HACS**:
   - Open Home Assistant and navigate to **HACS > Integrations > Explore & Download Repositories**.
   - Click the three-dot menu and select **Custom Repositories**.
   - Add the repository: `https://github.com/vortitron/energy-sensor-generator`, Category: **Integration**.

   - Copy the `custom_components/energy_sensor_generator` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
   - Restart Home Assistant.

3. **Configure the Integration**:
   - Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration**.
   - Search for "Energy Sensor Generator" and select it.
   - Configure the options:
     - **Auto Generate**: Enable to create sensors automatically on startup (recommended).
     - **Update Interval**: Set the frequency (in seconds) for energy calculations (default: 60).
   - Click **Submit** to complete setup.

4. **Add a Lovelace Button** (Optional for Manual Mode):
   - Edit your Lovelace dashboard (**Edit Dashboard > Add Card**).
   - Choose **Button** card and configure it:
     ```yaml
     type: button
     name: Generate Energy Sensors
     show_icon: true
     icon: mdi:lightning-bolt
     tap_action:
       action: call-service
       service: energy_sensor_generator.generate_sensors
     ```
   - Save the dashboard.

5. **Add Sensors to Energy Dashboard**:
   - Go to **Settings > Dashboards > Energy**.
   - Under **Individual Devices**, click **Add Device**.
   - Select the generated sensors (e.g., `sensor.plug_1_daily_energy`, `sensor.plug_1_monthly_energy`).
   - Save to display energy usage in the dashboard.

## Usage
- **Automatic Generation**:
  - If "Auto Generate" is enabled, sensors are created when Home Assistant starts or the integration is reloaded.
  - New power sensors (e.g., from newly added Tuya plugs) are detected automatically.
- **Manual Generation**:
  - Click the "Generate Energy Sensors" button in your Lovelace dashboard to create or update sensors.
  - This is useful if you add new devices and have "Auto Generate" disabled.
- **Device Swap Handling**:
  - If you swap a device between power sockets, use the `Reassign Energy Data` service to transfer energy data to the new device association.
  - Call the service `energy_sensor_generator.reassign_energy_data` with parameters `from_device` and `to_device` (e.g., `plug_1` to `plug_2`).
  - This updates the storage file to associate energy data with the new device name.
- **Monitoring**:
  - View sensor states in **Developer Tools > States** (e.g., `sensor.plug_1_energy`, `sensor.plug_1_daily_energy`).
  - Check energy usage in the **Energy** dashboard.
- **Logs**:
  - Monitor integration activity in **Settings > System > Logs**. Look for messages like:
    ```
    2025-05-11 10:00:00 INFO Generating energy sensors
    2025-05-11 10:00:01 INFO Reset daily energy for plug_1
    ```

## Example Output
For a power sensor `sensor.plug_1_power`, the integration creates:
- `sensor.plug_1_energy`: Cumulative kWh (e.g., `5.23 kWh`).
- `sensor.plug_1_daily_energy`: Daily kWh, resets at midnight (e.g., `0.45 kWh`).
- `sensor.plug_1_monthly_energy`: Monthly kWh, resets on the 1st (e.g., `12.67 kWh`).

Storage file (`.storage/energy_sensor_generator.json`):
```json
{
  "plug_1_energy": {"value": 5.23},
  "plug_1_daily_energy": {"value": 0.45, "last_reset": "2025-05-11T00:00:00"},
  "plug_1_monthly_energy": {"value": 12.67, "last_reset": "2025-05-01T00:00:00"}
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Logging
- **NEW**: You can now enable detailed debug logging to help troubleshoot issues without needing a new release
- Debug logging can be enabled during initial setup or toggled later in the integration options
- When enabled, detailed calculation logs will be written to help diagnose energy calculation issues
- Debug logging includes:
  - Statistical vs point sampling calculation details
  - Energy calculation breakdowns (power values, time deltas, conversion factors)
  - Sensor detection and unit conversion information
  - Interval update timing and calculation methods
- **To enable**: Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Energy Sensor Generator > Configure** and toggle "Debug Logging"
- Debug messages appear in **Settings > System > Logs** with the "DEBUG:" prefix
- **Note**: Disable debug logging once issues are resolved to reduce log verbosity

### Statistical Calculation Issues (RESOLVED)
- **✅ FIXED**: The previous blocking database call issues have been resolved in version 0.0.47
- **Historical Data Access**: The integration now properly uses `async_add_executor_job` to access Home Assistant's recorder data without blocking calls
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Statistical calculation now uses the same historical data that the Energy Dashboard uses, providing much more accurate energy calculations for devices with infrequent updates
- **Automatic Fallback**: If historical data is unavailable, the integration gracefully falls back to point sampling
- **Configuration**: Statistical calculation is enabled by default but can be disabled in integration options if needed
- **Perfect for Tuya Devices**: Now properly handles devices that only update every 5+ minutes by using historical state data instead of just current power readings

### Sensors Not Available During Startup:
- **New in v0.0.28**: The integration is now resilient to source power sensors not being available during Home Assistant startup
- Energy sensors are created even if source sensors aren't ready yet, and will begin tracking once sources become available
- Look for log messages like "Source sensor not yet available during startup" - this is normal and expected
- Energy tracking will begin automatically once the source power sensors finish loading
- If sensors remain unavailable after several minutes, check that the devices are properly configured and online

### No Power Sensors Found:
Ensure your devices (e.g., Tuya plugs) expose power sensors with unit: W or kW and device_class: power. Check in Developer Tools > States.
Use the LocalTuya integration for Tuya devices, as the official Tuya integration may not expose power data reliably.
Energy Values Incorrect:
Verify that power sensors update frequently (e.g., every 5-30 seconds). LocalTuya typically provides faster updates.
Adjust the update_interval in the integration settings to match your device's update frequency.
Check logs for warnings about invalid power values.
Storage Errors:
Ensure the .storage directory is writable: chmod -R 755 /config/.storage.
Monitor disk space to prevent write failures.
Energy Dashboard Issues:
Confirm sensors have device_class: energy and state_class: total_increasing in Developer Tools > States.
If the dashboard doesn't display data, try restarting Home Assistant or re-adding the sensors.
General Issues:
Check logs in Settings > System > Logs for errors.
Reinstall the integration via HACS if issues persist.
Report bugs or ask for help in the GitHub Issues section.
Limitations
Power Sensor Update Frequency:
Energy calculation accuracy depends on how often power sensors update. Tuya plugs using the official integration may update sporadically; LocalTuya is recommended.
Storage:
The JSON storage file grows with the number of sensors but remains small (a few KB per sensor). Monitor disk space for large installations.
Energy Dashboard:
If Home Assistant's Energy dashboard rejects custom sensors (unlikely), a future version may add MQTT support as a fallback.

## Troubleshooting

### kW Sensors Not Being Added

If you have power sensors with kW units that aren't being detected or added:

1. **Check sensor detection**: Call the debug service by going to Developer Tools → Services and calling:
   - Service: `energy_sensor_generator.debug_sensor_detection`
   - This will log detailed information about detected sensors

2. **Check the logs**: Look in Settings → System → Logs for messages from `energy_sensor_generator` showing:
   - Which sensors were detected and why
   - Whether kW sensors were found specifically
   - Any errors during sensor creation

3. **Manual selection**: In the integration's options (Settings → Devices & Services → Energy Sensor Generator → Configure), you can manually select the kW power sensors that should have energy sensors created

4. **Verify sensor attributes**: Check that your kW power sensors have:
   - `unit_of_measurement: kW` (or `kilowatt`/`kilowatts`)
   - `device_class: power` (optional but helpful)
   - A numeric state value
